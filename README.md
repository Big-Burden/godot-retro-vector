# godot-retro-vector
A godot plugin for imitating 3D vector graphics.

I've been trying to find a good method for imitating 3D vectors graphics for a while in Godot, a few years backs I implemented some obtuse solutions which werenâ€™t very friendly to work with, and have recently simplified the process down to just a shader, although it is missing quite a few features that I originally had I do plan on implementing those again soon.
